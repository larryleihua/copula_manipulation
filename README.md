# rotationally_symmetric_copula
For a bivariate copula C(u,v), the codes are used to construct a copula C'(u, v) = 0.5*Cbar(1-u, 1-v) + 0.5*C(u,v), which is a rotation of C(u,v) around the point (0.5, 0.5).

The basic functions for C'(u,v) are given for some cases that are based on commonly-used bivariate copulas: student t, Clayton, Joe, Gumbel, etc., and their non-exchangeable versions based on Khoudraji's transformation.
